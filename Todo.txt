BUGS
- what happen if delete account but there are dept still there
- if editing the Department Form, the location already existing doesnt load up and need to be reselected
- store in lower case in database and display capitalize, this would be to avoid dupplicated with case-sensitive

- after deleting, there is a useEffect trigger, so we have a routing error for the _id just deleted
- after deleting, there is sometimes the objects not reloading properly (manufacturers are empty)
=> Check if this can be avoided if we dont delete from the forms

DONE
- horizontal bar change to yellow -
- change the route with trigram to _id
