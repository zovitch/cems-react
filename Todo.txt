BUGS
- what happen if delete account but there are dept still there
- store in lower case in database and display capitalize, this would be to avoid dupplicated with case-sensitive
- bug not login auth error
- MachineForm: warning: react_devtools_backend.js:3973 Warning: `value` prop on `input` should not be null. Consider using an empty string to clear the component or `undefined` for uncontrolled components.
- it seems the date in each models is triggering a lot of useEffect, maybe we can improve that

- after deleting, there is a useEffect trigger, so we have a routing error for the _id just deleted
- after deleting, there is sometimes the objects not reloading properly (manufacturers are empty)
=> Check if this can be avoided if we dont delete from the forms

- change the route with trigram to _id
